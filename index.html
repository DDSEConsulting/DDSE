    <p class="mb-4">This patent has been declared essential and offered under FRAND terms in accordance with the ISO/IEC Patent Policy (<a href="https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/developing_standards/resources/docs/20221216_Guidelines_for_Implementation_of_the_Common_Patent_Policy.pdf" class="text-indigo-600 underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 Guidelines, Clause 2</a>).</p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">

      <li><strong>IEC 61508</strong> — Registered in IEC Patent Database (<a href="https://patents.iec.ch/iec/pa.nsf/pa_h.xsp?v=0#" class="text-indigo-600 underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view record</a>)</li>

      <li><strong>ISO 26262</strong> — Declaration submitted to ISO; awaiting official database listing</li>

      <p>The formal publication by IEC constitutes constructive notice of SEP status. Under U.S. patent law and ISO/IEC SEP policies, this public registry serves as lawful notice to all parties implementing the covered standard.</p>

      <p>Because ISO 26262, ISO 25119, IEC 62061, and other domain-specific safety standards are derived from IEC 61508, any implementer of those derivative standards is also expected to inquire into SEP declarations and comply with licensing obligations.</p>

      <p>Per legal precedent and industry practice, implementers cannot rely on willful blindness or omission. Constructive notice via this declaration places the burden on implementers to seek FRAND-compliant licenses before use.</p>

      <p>This SEP is enforceable against unauthorized use. Licensing is required for all implementations that rely on the patented methods—directly or via derived standards such as ISO 26262 or AUTOSAR safety frameworks.</p>
