# Computing System Software Development and Safety Mechanisms

This repository introduces a systematic approach for constructing computing system software and implementing safety mechanisms, focusing on two key attributes: **Data Value** and **Data Timing**. The methodology aims to optimize development processes and ensure system correctness and reliability.

## Overview

The invention proposes a definitive method to:

1. **Construct Computing System Software**:
   - Based on three essential components:
     - **Input Data**
     - **Middle Data**
     - **Output Data**
   - Define calculations or relationships between these components.

2. **Develop Safety Mechanisms**:
   - Ensure the software functions correctly by monitoring and controlling:
     - **Data Value**: Ensures accurate computation and relationships.
     - **Data Timing**: Manages system latency, including transmission and calculation durations.

3. **Optimize System Development Activities**:
   - Provide a systematic foundation for software construction, safety mechanisms, and their measurement criteria.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Data Attributes
Every computing system software has two, and only two, fundamental attributes:
- **Data Value**: Represents the correctness of the output data derived from the input and middle data through predefined calculations.
- **Data Timing**: Represents the system latency, including:
  - Data transmission durations.
  - Data calculation durations.

### 2. System Development Goals
The primary goal is to:
- Realize the required **Data Value** and **Data Timing** for each output data.
- Develop safety mechanisms to:
  - Detect deviations in **Data Value** and **Data Timing**.
  - Prevent the system from impacting others by outputting deviated data.

### 3. Safety Mechanism Objectives
- Identify deviations in **Data Value** and **Data Timing**.
- Prevent undesired system behaviors by addressing deviations effectively.
- Optimize development activities by integrating safety mechanisms with software construction.

## Benefits
- **Unified Framework**: Defines software construction and safety mechanism development once the data and their relationships are established.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces complexity by focusing on two attributes.
- **Reliability**: Ensures that deviations are detected and mitigated, minimizing the risk of failure.

## Conclusion
This approach provides a clear and systematic method to construct and validate computing system software and its safety mechanisms. By focusing exclusively on **Data Value** and **Data Timing**, development processes are significantly optimized while ensuring robust system functionality.
